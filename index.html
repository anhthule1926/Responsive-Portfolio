      <p>I was born in Vietnam. My family is consist of my mom, brothers and sister. My older brother and my dad left Vietnam when I was 2, a year later my mom decided that she to take my sister, brother and I and left Vietnam. I was 3 years old when we left Vietnam. We along with other people left Vietnam in a small boat in the middle of the night.</p>

      <p>We were stranded for days in the ocean before we made it Malaysia. Once we maded it to Malaysia we were placed in the refugee camp and spent the next 5 years there. My mom had to go through an interview process before we could come to the US and re-united with my brother.</p>

      <p>Since coming to the US, I have spend most of my life growing up in Minnesota. No matter where we were planning to move to we always came back to Minnesota, because it's home.</p>
