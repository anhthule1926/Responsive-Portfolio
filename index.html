      <p>I was born in Vietnam. My family is consist of my mom, brothers and sister. My older brother and my dad left Vietnam when I was 2, a year later my mom decided that she to take my sister, brother and I and left Vietnam. I was 3 years old when we left Vietnam. We along with other people left Vietnam in a small boat in the middle of the night.</p>

      <p>We were stranded for days in the ocean before we made it Malaysia. Once we maded it to Malaysia we were placed in the refugee camp and spent the next 5 years there. We were luck enough to come to the US in 1994, beause after we left the all of the refugee camps got closed down.</p>

      <p>Becuase of where I came from and background I love to travel and experience new things. I have done zip lining, parasailing, swimming with the turtles, 13 miles hike to Havasupai, and have travel to so many places. I love being expose to new culture and food.</p>
